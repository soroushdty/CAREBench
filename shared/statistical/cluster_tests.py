"""Patient-cluster randomization tests.

Cells (for example (patient, item, class) observations) from the same
patient share a context snapshot and a reference observer group, so they
are correlated.  Tests that treat cells as independent understate the
p-value.  The sign-flip test here keeps each patient's cells together: under
the null, each patient's summed contribution is symmetric about zero, so its
sign can be flipped as a block.

With few patients the test is exact: all ``2 ** n_clusters`` sign patterns
are enumerated when that number does not exceed ``n_permutations``.  This
also means the smallest attainable one-sided p-value is ``2 ** -n_clusters``
(1/64 with six patients), which is the honest limit of a design with that
many patients.

The within-cluster permutation test asks a different question: whether a
model's deltas line up with the reference deltas of *the same item*, rather
than merely with the patient's items in general.  It shuffles the model's
delta rows among the items of each patient and leaves the reference deltas
in place.
