# Orchestrator (`tracks/representation/statistical/orchestrator`)

Canonical location: `tracks/representation/statistical/orchestrator/`

This module is the sole entry point for the entire statistical analysis phase. It
sequences all hypothesis tests, diagnostic checks, sub-field ablation, architecture
comparison, and figure generation in a fixed, reproducible order and serializes every
artefact to disk.

```python

## Config keys consumed

The orchestrator reads the following keys from `cfg`:

| Key                                             | Source                 | Default             | Purpose                             |

## Pipeline steps

### Step 1 — Core deltas and confirmatory filter

Computes `Δ_p = y_interview − y_survey` and `Δ_m = y_hat_ca − y_hat_cf` via
`shared.statistical.delta`. Partitions classes into confirmatory-eligible (≥ `min_nonzero` non-zero
`Δ_p` values) and descriptive-only. The two lists are passed to every subsequent step that
needs them.

### Step 2 — τ robustness check

Calls `shared.statistical.tau_check.tau_robustness_check(tau_fixed, avg_thresh_f1opt, class_list)`.
A one-line summary is written to the log. Classes with `|τ_fixed − τ_F1opt| > 0.05` are
flagged in the output CSV.

**Output:** `tau_robustness.csv`

### Step 3 — Load individual physician labels

Builds a raw-item-to-canonical-item standardizer from `DIR_JSON_MAP` using the same
`normalize_for_matching()` logic applied during preprocessing. This ensures that items
read from the raw Excel sheet will match keys in `item_texts_test`. Falls back to raw
strings with a warning if the mapping file is unavailable or the build fails.

Calls `shared.statistical.icc.load_individual_physician_labels()`. Used in Steps 9 and 14.

### Step 4 — Directional alignment per class (formerly H1)

Calls `tracks.representation.statistical.hypotheses.h1.h1_binomial_per_class`. The confirmatory p-value (`perm_p`) is a
within-patient permutation test of sign agreement against its chance level (`null_rate`): the class's model deltas are
shuffled among each patient's items. The sign-flip test of agreement > 0.5 (`cluster_p`) and the exact binomial p-value
(`binom_p`) are kept for reference only. BH FDR correction is applied to `perm_p` across confirmatory-eligible classes;
all classes are reported with their `confirmatory` flag.

**Output:** `directional_alignment_per_class.csv`

### Step 5 — Directional alignment pooled (permutation test)

Calls `tracks.representation.statistical.hypotheses.h1.h1_permutation_test` with `n_permutations = 10_000` (configurable
via `statistical_analysis.n_permutations`). Patient rows of `delta_m` are shuffled within
each patient block, pooled across confirmatory-eligible classes.

**Output:** `directional_alignment_pooled.json`

### Step 6 — Directional alignment across classes (CMH)

Calls `tracks.representation.statistical.hypotheses.h1.h1_cmh_test`. Builds one 2×2 table per confirmatory-eligible class
(stratified by physician-delta direction) and combines them via the Mantel-Haenszel
common-odds-ratio statistic. `p_permutation` is a within-patient permutation test of the common odds ratio > 1 (each
patient's model delta rows are shuffled among that patient's items). `p_cmh` treats cells as independent and `p_cluster`
tests pooled sign agreement > 0.5; both are kept for reference only.

**Output:** `directional_alignment_cmh.json`

### Step 7 — Brier improvement per class and macro summary (formerly H2)

Calls `tracks.representation.statistical.hypotheses.h2.h2_wilcoxon_per_class` then `h2_macro_summary`. The confirmatory
p-value (`cluster_p`) is a one-sided patient-cluster sign-flip test of whether context-aware Brier scores are lower; the
Wilcoxon signed-rank p-value (`wilcoxon_p`) treats items as independent and is kept for reference only. BH FDR
correction is applied to `cluster_p` across all classes.

**Outputs:** `brier_improvement_per_class.csv`, `brier_improvement_summary.json`

### Step 8 — Wasserstein distance (descriptive)

Calls `tracks.representation.statistical.hypotheses.h2.h2_wasserstein_per_class`. Secondary/sensitivity measure; no FDR
correction applied.

**Output:** `wasserstein_distance.csv`

### Step 9 — ICC rater-level analysis

Calls `shared.statistical.icc.rater_icc_analysis` using the interview split of `individual_labels`
from Step 3. Computes one model-vs-physician ICC(2,1) per (patient, physician) and one
within-pair human-human ICC(2,1) per patient, each with Lin's CCC as a secondary metric. Failures are
caught and logged as warnings (ICC is skipped rather than aborting the pipeline).

**Outputs:** `icc_results.csv`, `icc_summary.json`

### Step 9.5 — Calibration ECE per class

Calls `shared.evaluation.calibration.calibration_ece_per_class` against `y_hat_ca` and `y_interview`
using 15 equal-width bins. Classes with ECE > 0.10 are flagged and logged as warnings.

**Output:** `calibration_ece.csv`

### Step 10 — Context-induced entropy change

Computes `physician_entropy_change` and `model_entropy_change` per (item, class).
Serializes the full per-(item, patient, class) table and the aggregate Pearson r summary.

**Outputs:** `entropy_change.csv`, `entropy_pearson.json`

### Step 11 — Stratum analysis

If `strata` is not pre-supplied, calls `tracks.representation.statistical.reporting.stratum.assign_test_strata` using
`item_texts` and `item_texts_train`. Then calls `stratum_comparison` to compute sign
agreement rate and Brier improvement for each stratum with Mann-Whitney U tests. Skipped
with a warning if neither `strata` nor `item_texts_train` is provided.

**Output:** `stratum_analysis.csv`

### Step 12 — Sub-field ablation

Runs if both `ensemble_bundle_path` and `context_json` are provided. See
[Sub-field ablation](#sub-field-ablation) below.

**Output:** `ablation_scores.csv`

### Step 13 — Architectural comparison

Runs if `arch_predictions` is provided (a dict mapping architecture names to `(n_pairs, n_classes)`
prediction arrays). Calls `tracks.representation.statistical.reporting.arch_compare.arch_comparison_table` with paired
bootstrap differences against the `"2d"` reference architecture.

**Output:** `arch_comparison.csv`

### Step 14 — Figures

Generates all four output figures. Each is wrapped in a try/except so a single figure
failure does not abort the pipeline.

- **Figure 1** — always generated (requires only `delta_p`)
- **Figure 2** — skipped if `individual_labels` is empty
- **Figure 3** — skipped if `icc_results` is empty
- **Figure 4** — always generated (requires only entropy deltas)

**Outputs:** `figures/figure1_delta_histogram.png`, `figures/figure2_interphysician_agreement.png`,
`figures/figure3_icc_horizontal_plot.png`, `figures/figure4_entropy_scatter.png`
